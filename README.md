# repetition.py
Using repetition, we can improve insert_separator() so that the number of times the separating character shows up is passed into the function.
Excercise practice for activity directions:
Open strings/Exercises/hello_you.py in your editor.
Modify the insert_separator() function so that the number of times the separating character shows up is passed in as a parameter. It should default to show up 30 times.
Modify the calls to insert_separator() so that they pass in an argument to the new parameter.
